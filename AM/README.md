Repository for redirecting to Monni97 resources.
Repository created to store the redirections of the resources created by Andrea Monaldini (https://github.com/Monni97).

For the moment the repository stores one folder, i.e., 'pizzaontology', which contains an example ontology about the pizza domain.

In the future, it will store the redirections to the vocabularies I develop
